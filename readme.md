Since Gym and Retro Gym run only on some version of python we need to make sure we have the proper version of python.

Running this command will make sure you are running the correct version of python.

```
$ conda create --name gym36 python=3.6 
```

In order to get this project running you first need to install the dependencies:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The next step is to find your LEGAL copy of Sonic the Hedgehog.

Once you have your copy of Sonic the Hedgehog you can run the sonic.py file.
